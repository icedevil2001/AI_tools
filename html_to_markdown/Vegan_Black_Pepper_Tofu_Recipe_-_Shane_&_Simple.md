*This **vegan Black Pepper Tofu recipe** is a delicious tofu stir fry with crunchy red bell peppers and red onion smothered in a sweet, peppery sauce. Serve it over brown or white rice for an easy weeknight meal thatâ€™s healthier and way better than takeout!*

![black pepper tofu on rice.](https://shaneandsimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EASY-black-pepper-tofu-vegan-plantbased-simple-recipe-shaneandsimple-6.jpg)

Iâ€™m convinced the people who donâ€™t like tofu simply donâ€™t know how to cook tofu. Get ready to blow their minds!

Spicy foods are my weakness, and after making this **Cajun Blackened Tofu Sandwich**, the only logical solution seemed to be this black pepper tofu.

There are several other tofu recipes on my site, but none compare to this dish. Get ready to be amazed! This black pepper tofu recipe is a copycat version of the popular take-out black pepper chicken.

Tofu cubes are lightly tossed in cornstarch and baked until crispy. Once the tofu is finished baking, itâ€™s added to a pan with some healthy sautÃ©ed veggies and this is where things get really wild.

Everything gets smothered in the **black pepper sauce**. Itâ€™s an intensely flavorful sauce thatâ€™s slightly sweet and sticky, extremely spicy, and guaranteed to rock the taste buds.

Finally, itâ€™s served over rice and garnished with some shredded carrots and chopped green onion for freshness and color. (pardon me while I drool ðŸ¤¤)

This is a great recipe for a quick, easy, and healthy weeknight dinner. Itâ€™s filling and sure to quickly become a family favorite!

## Ingredients youâ€™ll need

Simple ingredients come together to create this extremely delicious dish. The combination of umami flavors and the meaty texture of the tofu is absolutely mind-blowing!

![Ingredients.](data:image/svg+xml...)![Ingredients.](https://shaneandsimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EASY-black-pepper-tofu-vegan-plantbased-simple-recipe-shaneandsimple-1.jpg)

* **[Soy sauce](https://amzn.to/3lsZE3C)**: Itâ€™s best to use low-sodium [soy sauce](https://amzn.to/3lsZE3C).
* **[Maple syrup](https://amzn.to/2EPxK0M)**: The sweetness of the [maple syrup](https://amzn.to/2EPxK0M) balances out the spiciness of the black pepper.
* **Black pepper**: You can use whole peppercorns and a spice grinder to make your own crushed black pepper. But I buy it already crushed because itâ€™s easy and accessible.
* **Ginger**: I prefer dried ginger over fresh ginger for simplicity. If using fresh ginger, double the amount.
* **Tofu**: [Extra firm tofu](https://amzn.to/2w0cS2R) works best for this recipe, but you can use regular firm or [super firm tofu](https://amzn.to/2TyRxH0).
* **Cornstarch**: For coating the tofu pieces, they will develop a thin crust as they bake.
* **Bell peppers**: Red or green bell pepper are both acceptable. I prefer red simply for the color and presentation.
* **Red onion**: This is my preference, but you can use whatever type of onion you prefer or simply leave it out.
* **Garlic cloves**: You can use either minced or sliced garlic.

See the recipe card down below for specific amounts and instructions.

## How to make this vegan Black Pepper Tofu recipe

You can have this dish on the table in 30 minutes! If this is your first time cooking with tofu, prepare to be amazed. My only suggestion would be to go easy on the pepper at first if youâ€™re sensitive to spicy things.

1. Start by making the black pepper sauce. In a small bowl, combine the [soy sauce](https://amzn.to/3lsZE3C), [maple syrup](https://amzn.to/2EPxK0M), crushed black pepper, and ginger. [Whisk](https://amzn.to/2NRksDU) until everything is well combined and set aside.
2. Preheat your oven to 400ËšF and start preparing the tofu by cutting it into 1â€³ cubes.
3. Add the tofu cubes to a medium bowl and toss with the cornstarch until the tofu is evenly coated.
4. Transfer tofu to a lined baking tray with [parchment paper](https://amzn.to/2BksDRL) and evenly spread the tofu. Bake for 25-30 minutes until it starts to brown and crisp up. Remove from the oven and set aside.
5. Preheat a non-stick [frying pan](https://amzn.to/2ncaHVX) or [cast iron skillet](https://amzn.to/31rGQqT) over medium-high heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, and garlic and cook for 3-4 minutes.
6. Add the crispy tofu to the pan with the sautÃ©ed vegetables, pour in the black pepper sauce, and stir until all of the tofu pieces are fully covered. Cook for 1-2 minutes while consistently stirring. The sauce will slightly thicken as it cooks.
7. Serve over [brown rice](https://amzn.to/3tyiB8K) and garnish with shredded carrots and chopped green onions.

**Hint**: You canÂ **air fry**Â the tofu atÂ **400ËšF for 10-15 minutes**. Cooking time will ultimately depend on the type of air fryer.

![Black pepper tofu in cast iron skillet.](data:image/svg+xml...)![Black pepper tofu in cast iron skillet.](https://shaneandsimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EASY-black-pepper-tofu-vegan-plantbased-simple-recipe-shaneandsimple-5.jpg)
## Whatâ€™s the best way to press tofu?

Pressing the tofu isnâ€™t necessary for this recipe, but it does help the tofu to get crispy as it bakes. The easiest way is to use a [tofu press](https://amzn.to/3DUu4Wq), but if you donâ€™t have one, have no fear. Hereâ€™s how you do it: simply wrap the whole block of tofu in paper towels

1. **Drain and wrap**: Remove the tofu from its packaging and drain any excess liquid. Wrap the tofu in a few layers of paper towels or a clean dish towel.
2. **Press**: Place the wrapped tofu on a plate or [cutting board](https://amzn.to/2ZqmlgR). Then, top it with a heavy object, like a [cast iron skillet](https://amzn.to/31rGQqT) with cans inside. You can also sandwich the tofu between plates or cutting boards. Press down gently, being careful not to break the tofu, and let it sit for at least 10-15 minutes.
3. **Remove the weight**: Unwrap the tofu, cut it into your desired shape, and use it in recipes. You can also freeze it for a chewier texture.

![Black pepper tofu on plate with rice.](data:image/svg+xml...)![Black pepper tofu on plate with rice.](https://shaneandsimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EASY-black-pepper-tofu-vegan-plantbased-simple-recipe-shaneandsimple-8.jpg)
## Substitutions

Here are a few suggestions for substitutions if you have different tastes or dietary needs.

* **Onions**Â â€“ feel free to use another type, like white onion or spring onions.
* **[Soy sauce](https://amzn.to/3lsZE3C)**Â â€“ there are many different kinds of [soy sauce](https://amzn.to/3lsZE3C), but I recommend low-sodium [soy sauce](https://amzn.to/3lsZE3C). To make this dish gluten-free, use low-sodium [tamari](https://amzn.to/38GlOvu) sauce. You can find these at most local grocery stores or any Asian market.
* **Spice**Â â€“ this is a very spicy recipe. If youâ€™re sensitive to spice cut the amount of black pepper by half at first. You can also eliminate the pepper and use a tablespoon of seasoned rice vinegar.

## Black Pepper Tofu variations

I think this tofu dish is perfect as is, but try using some of these different options. Itâ€™ll help you get creative and change things up a bit to suit your taste.

* **Spicy**Â â€“ if you really like spicy food you can add a dash of red pepper flakes or thinly sliced chili peppers.
* **Vegetables**Â â€“ mix it up with different veggies. Broccoli, asparagus, fresh green beans, carrots, and bok choy are some of my favorites.
* **Protein**â€“ tempeh, seitan, or extra veggies can be used in place of the tofu.

![Black pepper tofu on white rice.](data:image/svg+xml...)![Black pepper tofu on white rice.](https://shaneandsimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EASY-black-pepper-tofu-vegan-plantbased-simple-recipe-shaneandsimple-7.jpg)
## Storage

Leftover black pepper tofu can be stored in an airtight containerÂ **in the refrigerator for 4-5 days**. When youâ€™re ready to enjoy it, reheat it in the microwave.

## Top tips

Follow these tips to ensure your black tofu pepper recipe is awesome!

* Be sure to press the tofu so it will crisp up when baking.
* To enhance the flavor, roast some black peppercorns and grind with a mortar and pestle.
* If youâ€™re sensitive to spicy foods, start out light with the pepper.
* For best results, be sure and use extra-[firm tofu](https://amzn.to/2w1vP5g).
* Use a [silicone baking mat](https://amzn.to/2zAVUrk) in place of [parchment paper](https://amzn.to/2BksDRL) for better results.
* Donâ€™t overcook the tofu or it will become more chewy than crispy.

   I made this last night. I have made this with black pepper sauce from a jar, so was intrigued to see the recipe to made my own. It was simple and so tasty! A great recipe. I added sliced white mushrooms and doubled the sauce. The carrots as garnish were a great touch. Thank you!

    Easy and delicious â€“ what more could I want? Thanks Shane for another fun recipe that will be added to my rotation! It was a bit spicy for me, but perfect for my hubby. Iâ€™ll try 1/2 T of crushed pepper next time. I also used your tip on the air fryer and 15 min was perfect. I used 8 oz of tempeh instead of tofu per your options. I was amazed at how well the cornstarch worked to make the tofu golden brown and crunchy.

    This recipe was delicious. A bit spicy for my taste, and I even used less than half of a tablespoon of black pepper. Glad it didnâ€™t linger on the taste buds like chili peppers. Next time I will try Thai peppers for my hubby and sons. He said it was very good, only he asked for a pepper with more character. ðŸ˜‚. I can see making this for me, and a separate one for the spicy pepper lovers. Iâ€™m glad I found you on FB.
